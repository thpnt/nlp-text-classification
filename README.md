# NLP Text Classification exploration
Text classification on the Toxic Comment Dataset.
I explored classic NLP networks (RNN, GRU-based, LTSM-based) as well as the Transformer architechture (BERT-finetuning)

I developped a multi-thread text processing pipeline.
I deployed the models in a streamlit app for fun interaction.

Run docker build to try it out.
